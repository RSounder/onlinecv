      "content": "An automated system to evaluate the performance of Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) using simulated human-like actuation. The PDA unit under test (UUT) is mounted on a 3DOF delta robot which orients it to different angles as touch, voice and gesture commands are simulated via an ATE system that consists of a 4 DOF SCARA robot, speaker, mic and a 3D depth sensor. Test cases are written alongside expected results; The robot arm is actuated to simulate touch and gestures while speaker plays an audio clip generated using Text-to-speech algorithms. PDA outputs are collected using screen recordings and voice outputs. These are analysed using RNN based deep learning models to evaluate the performance of UUTs. Building the two robots, configuration and programming using ROS, real time sensor data analysis and deep learning models were learning outcomes. Python and NLP algorithms were mastered",

It needs to have a clear beginning, a definite end, and an overview of what happens in between. A project creates something new – Every project is unique, producing something that did not previously exist. A project is a one-time, once-off activity, never to be repeated exactly the same way again. A project has boundaries – A project operates within certain constraints of time, money, quality, and functionality. We’ll see more about this in later sections.",
